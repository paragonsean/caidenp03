  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Here is what I would like to include:</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center;">A source for students to connect with each other, specifically
    a way for them to build projects together. They will make postings that other students can see.<br>
    These postings will be projects other students from different majors can interact with if they are interested.
    Students can then work together to get experience, while learning the ropes!</p>
  </header>

  

  <h2>The need for this work is obvious, here are some ways students can benefit:</h2>
  <p>Students need experience to get experience now, companies that hire "entry level jobs" are now <br>
    asking these new hires to have one or two years of experience. This causes trouble for many college students looking
    for ways to get into the work force. <br>My solution is to provide a way for students to connect with each other
    and gain experience while still learning.</p>
  <h3>A little about me:</h3>
  <p>I am a college student studying computer science at Old Dominion University. I spend my free time <br>
    learning new things, playing video games, or recreational athletics. I want to make the college 
    <br> experience easier for new students as the work force becomes more difficult to enter.</p>
